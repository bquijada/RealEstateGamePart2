# Real Estate Game

Welcome to our Monopoly-like game! This is a Python project that allows up to 4 users to play the classic board game, Monopoly, on one computer. The game features rolling dice, moving around a game board, buying spaces or paying rent, and keeping track of everyone's money. Players lose when they run out of money, and the game ends when only one person is left. The UI is coded using the tkinter library.

## Installation

To install the Monopoly game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## How to Play

To start the Monopoly game, run the `monopoly.py` file in your terminal. This will launch the game window.

1. At the start of the game, each player rolls the dice to determine who goes first. The player with the highest number goes first, and play continues clockwise.
2. On each turn, the player rolls the dice and moves their token around the board. The player then performs an action based on the space they landed on, such as buying a property or paying rent.
3. The game keeps track of everyone's money, and players lose when they run out of money. The game ends when only one person is left.

## How to Customize

If you want to customize the Monopoly game, you can do so by modifying the following files:

- `board.py`: This file defines the layout and properties of the Monopoly game board.
- `player.py`: This file defines the behavior of the players in the game, such as buying properties and paying rent.
- `ui.py`: This file defines the UI of the game using the tkinter library.

You can modify these files to change the behavior and appearance of the Monopoly game.
