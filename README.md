# Real Estate Game

Welcome to our Monopoly-like game! This is a Python project that allows up to 4 users to play the classic board game, Monopoly, on one computer. The game features rolling dice, moving around a game board, buying spaces or paying rent, collecting money at GO, and keeping track of everyone's money. Players lose when they run out of money, and the game ends when only one person is left. The UI is coded using the tkinter library.
